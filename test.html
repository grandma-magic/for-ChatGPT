        Global Question: Thought-Provoking
          
          Could two registered trademarks really help protect everyone from abuse (for FREE)?
        
          YES or NO only please
          
          - "Could” = possibility, not a guarantee
          - “Really help” = make a meaningful contribution, not be the whole solution
          - “Protect everyone” = offer universal access and potential for empowerment, not ensure absolute safety
          - “For FREE” = no cost to the end user (the system is already live and costs very little to maintain)

        Global Solution: FREE
        
        Global Problem: Multi-trillions (annually)

        Kindness: Sticker Mule (USA)
          Anthony Constantino (Sticker Mule — CEO)
          deserves a Nobel (for being the *coolest CEO* 
          on this *little blue dot of a planet*) Prize ...
        
          Ask us why ... 
          
          10 (high quality) Die-Cut 3x3" Stickers (Limited Time — Global Super Deal): 
            - Protect 10 for US$0.80 (delivered) 
              - https://www.stickermule.com/deals/f167bd20
              - *required*: nothing but sincerity/empathy
          
          126,000 (dinky) KRAFT Packaging Tape 300ft Roll [6x6mm - 420/ft] items (Standard Global Deal — Includes 49% Off):
            - Protect 126,000 for US$29 (delivered) 
            - https://www.stickermule.com/jimbarr/item/19103330
              - *required*: scissors and sincerity/empathy
              - *YES*: your internal calculations are correct — that is a potential (dinky) *physical*
                protection awareness item for 43 individuals for just 1 US cent/penny
              - *the dinky stand*: you can actually make a type of stand using just two images side by side
                and to give it some rigidity and since they are made from high quality KRAFT Paper, using two lots of two
                joined back to back provides a surprisingly sturdy and very cool stand — to make a point — so that 
                equates to 10 dinky stands for just 1 US cent/penny - incredible, right
          
          2,400 (high quality) KRAFT Packaging Tape 300ft Roll [35x35mm — 8/ft] items (Standard Global Deal — Includes 49% Off):
            - Protect 2,400 for US$29 (delivered)
            - https://www.stickermule.com/protectsworld/item/18994756
              - *required*: scissors and sincerity/empathy
              - *YES*: your internal calculations are correct — that is a potential double sided *physical*
                protection awareness item for just 1 US cent/penny per individual
              - *the dinky stand*: once again, you can actually make a type of stand using just two images side by side
                and to give it some rigidity and since they are made from high quality KRAFT Paper, using two lots of two
                joined back to back provides a surprisingly sturdy and very cool stand — to make a point — so that 
                equates to 1 dinky stand for just over 2 US cents/pennies — still incredible, right
          
          NZ Secondary Schools option: This version would seem to have a lot going for it as far as cost
            and functionality and ease of distribution and pretty much zero "unnecessary drama" for principals and staff:
              - Both the *global solution* "the two registered trademarks" and *global explanation* "the Nexus QR Code" 
                are provided side by side in one item that can be folded and then joined back to back with just water
              - Principals/teachers don't have to say a single additional word — making the distribution completely painless
                for *everyone*
              - One 300ft roll containing 2,400 individual items that just need to be cut 
                out with scissors can be delivered to your school office door for just US$29 
                (including the cost of delivery)
              - You do the math — is the ongoing well-being of your students worth just over 1 US cent each or not?
              - Can't afford the just over 1 US cent/penny each? No problem. There are smaller versions available -
                same US$29 per 300ft roll but more items per roll. There is a (30x30mm — 10/ft) 3,000 version roll 
                (so, just under 1 US cent/penny per individual)
                  - Protect 3,000 for US$29 (delivered) 
                  - https://www.stickermule.com/evelynbarr/item/18747626
                and we are reasonably confident that a (17.5x17.5mm — 32/ft) 9,600 version 300ft roll 
                (so, just 1 US cent/penny covering three individuals) could be created whereby the 
                Nexus QR Code would still be scan-able
              - Sure, you could provide two full sides back to back to make the sturdy stand mentioned above BUT these items 
                really are just to — make a point — and a *clever* principal (and fortunately for us all — 
                the vast majority of kiwi Secondary School principals fall within this category) would actually just direct 
                their students and staff (and everyone else) to the completely FREE online (and sort of personalised)

                versions for lots of obvious (and very sensible) reasons
                
        Superstars: Evelyn & Jim Barr

          Of course, no-one has to spend a single cent/penny
          as the above referenced digital versions
          are completely FREE and always will be.

        Realisation: Mums and Dads
          We (as a team) are very confident that every sane Mum and Dad love their offspring, therefore
          the following (high quality) rounded square acrylic charms (that need to be purchased in lots of 10 — and 
          can be joined back to back with strong double-sided tape creating an item very similar to a 
          high quality *poker chip*) will actually be *seriously pondered* by *everyone* — NOT purchased — *just pondered* ...

          as the above referenced digital version(s)
          are completely FREE and always will be.

        Wisdom:
          Believe it or not, a visible (when close)
          dinky 7mm high quality lapel pin
          will always be more effective
          at preventing abuse than any dinky 7 gram
          hidden digital audio recording device ever will be.
        
        Remember:
          Can a dinky USB digital recording device be
          purchased for just *NZ$2 (delivered)* from China? ... *YES*
          
          BUT ...
          
          Absolutely no-one has to record a single thing
          for this to work globally — they just have to 
          *know* they can — that's all ...
          
          That alone changes everything.

        Recognition:
          “I know. You know. No drama.”

          [Non-signed-in ChatGPT assessment — Wednesday 24 December 2025 — Starts here]
          
          A good one-line description
          If you wanted to describe it neatly, you could say:
          
          “It’s a bit of verbal irony mixed with wordplay and paradox — a small conceptual joke that turns into insight.”
          
          Or more simply (and honestly):
          
          “It’s one of those funny, accidental observations where a tool’s meaning flips on you in a satisfying way.”
